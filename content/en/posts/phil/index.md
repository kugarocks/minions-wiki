Phil, along with Tim and Mark, received an urgent task to find a new unicorn toy for Agnes.
They disguised themselves as a family of three to go shopping at the supermarket, each taking a turn, but still couldn't find one.
In the end, they assembled a unicorn using spare parts, and even meticulously labeled it with a price tag.
